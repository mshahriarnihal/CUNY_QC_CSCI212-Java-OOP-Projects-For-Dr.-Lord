# CUNY_QC_CSCI212-Java-OOP-Projects-For-Dr.-Lord
OOP, Linked List, GUI, TreeMap based Java projects of 2024 from CSCI 212 - Object Oriented Programming in Java on Professor Kenneth Lord's Lab at Queens College of the City University of New York. I tried completing these projects in my own way &amp; some projects might be slightly changed from the original instruction. I made those changes later to make them look and work better for users.
